### Machine Learning & Data Science Projects:
This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine Learning, and Scientific Data Visualization. 
The projects explore the intersection of real-time sensor data (via webcams) and mathematical modeling.

### -Tech Stack:
The following core technologies and versions were used across these projects:
Python and MediaPipe: 0.10.15 (Hand Tracking, Pose Estimation, and Landmark Detection)
OpenCV: Image processing and real-time video manipulation
NumPy: Numerical computing and multi-dimensional array processing
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing
Matplotlib: Static, animated, and interactive visualizations

### -Project Categories:
Real-Time Computer Vision: Using MediaPipe and OpenCV, these projects involve detecting human body landmarks to create interactive experiences. 
This includes: Multi-hand tracking and handedness classification.
Spatial coordinate geometry to detect gestures based on Euclidean distance.
Canvas-based drawing systems using bitwise operations.
Statistical Modeling & Data Visualization
Utilizing NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib to translate raw data into meaningful insights. 
Key areas include: Visualizing probability distributions (e.g., Normal/Gaussian Bell Curves).
Data scaling and normalization for machine learning pipelines.
Plotting complex mathematical functions.
